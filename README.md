# ClassWeb
I want to make my class' website to let my classmates easily get contact book / announcement.

You can copy it to your server and edit them, if you want to share your redesigned website with me, you can create new [Pull Request](https://github.com/huacat1017/ClassWeb/pulls) or other ways you can tell me.

You can also see [Change Log](CHANGELOG.md) if you want to know my editing history.

If you have any issues, feel free to report bugs on [Issues](https://github.com/huacat1017/ClassWeb/issues).
# Future Plan
- Login with Google Account
- Save my classmates' profiles
- Record their homework
- Add homework easily by browser
- Manage data by SQL/PHP
